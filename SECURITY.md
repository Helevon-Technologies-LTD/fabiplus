## üîß Security Configuration

### Environment Variables

```bash
# JWT Configuration
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-key-here
JWT_ALGORITHM=HS256
JWT_ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES=30

# Security Settings
SECURITY_ENABLED=true
CORS_ENABLED=true
CORS_ORIGINS=["https://yourdomain.com"]

# Rate Limiting
RATE_LIMITING_ENABLED=true
RATE_LIMIT_PER_MINUTE=60

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost/dbname
```

### Production Security Checklist

- [ ] Use HTTPS with valid SSL certificates
- [ ] Set strong JWT secret key
- [ ] Configure CORS for your domain only
